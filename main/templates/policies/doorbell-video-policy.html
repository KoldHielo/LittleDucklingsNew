<section id="doorbell-video-policy">
  <p>As part of maintaining a safe and secure environment for children in my care, I use a video doorbell at the entrance to my home. This device allows me to see who is arriving before opening the door, ensuring that no child is released to an unauthorised person and that the premises remain secure.</p>

  <h2>Purpose of Recording</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The doorbell camera is used solely for safeguarding and security purposes.</li>
    <li>It provides reassurance that children are collected only by authorised individuals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Footage is not monitored live by anyone other than myself or my husband.</li>
    <li>Recordings are stored securely within the encrypted system provided by the device manufacturer.</li>
    <li>Footage will only be shared if required by law or requested by relevant authorities (e.g., Ofsted, police, or safeguarding agencies).</li>
    <li>Parents and visitors have the right to ask how their images are stored and for how long.</li>
    <li>Images are not used for any purpose other than safety and safeguarding.</li>
    <li>No footage will be posted on social media or shared with unauthorised individuals.</li>
    <li>Parents are informed of the doorbell camera on enrolment and given this policy for transparency.</li>
  </ul>
