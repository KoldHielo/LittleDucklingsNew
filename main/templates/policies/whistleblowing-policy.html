<section id="whistleblowing-policy">
  <p>The welfare of the child is paramount. In my role as a childminder I have a duty to report unacceptable behaviour to the relevant authorities; including that of assistants who may be working with me, other childminders, childcare workers and other professionals working with children. This action is necessary when their actions are detrimental to children, have placed a child at risk, caused actual harm to a child or are clearly illegal.</p>

  <p>I will follow the listed procedure if I suspect any of the above has taken place:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the inappropriate practice;</li>
    <li>Record exactly what was observed;</li>
    <li>Establish witnesses wherever possible;</li>
    <li>Keep copies of all correspondence and relevant information;</li>
    <li>Seek support from colleagues;</li>
    <li>Ask to be informed about the outcome.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In these situations, I may need to contact the police, social workers, the care inspectorate and any other relevant bodies, then pass on any information known to me.</p>

  <p>There is a Whistleblowing Advice Line by the NSPCC where they offer free advice and support to professionals and others who may be concerned about how child protection issues are being handled in their own or another organisation. If I or whoever is reading this Safeguarding Policy believe an organisation is putting children at risk, then they must contact the helpline on <strong>0808 800 5000</strong> or email <a href="mailto:help@nspcc.org.uk">help@nspcc.org.uk</a> confidentially to make the report.</p>

  <p>If you wish to whistleblow, here are the procedures you should follow in order to report any concerns.</p>

  <h2>You should raise a concern if you believe that:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A child is at risk of harm, neglect, or abuse.</li>
    <li>The safety, welfare, or rights of children are being compromised.</li>
    <li>There is illegal, improper, or unsafe practice taking place.</li>
    <li>Policies, procedures, or statutory requirements are not being followed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Raise a Concern</h2>
  <p>If the child is at immediate risk call <strong>999</strong> or contact the police on <strong>101</strong> if you think a crime has been committed.</p>

  <p>Concerns can be raised in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Directly to me (the childminder)</strong> – You can speak to me in person or in writing. I will listen carefully, take the concern seriously, and act promptly.</li>
    <li>If you do not feel able to raise it with me or the concern is about my conduct, you can contact:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ofsted:</strong> 0300 123 1231 or <a href="mailto:whistleblowing@ofsted.gov.uk">whistleblowing@ofsted.gov.uk</a></li>
        <li><strong>NSPCC Whistleblowing Advice Line:</strong> 0800 028 0285 or <a href="mailto:help@nspcc.org.uk">help@nspcc.org.uk</a></li>
        <li><strong>Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO):</strong> Speak to LADO through the Integrated Front Door (IFD) service on 01782 235100</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>All concerns will be handled sensitively. Your identity will be kept confidential wherever possible, but it may be necessary to share information with relevant agencies if a child is at risk.</p>
  <p>No one who raises a genuine concern will suffer harassment, victimisation, or unfair treatment. Even if concerns turn out to be unfounded, they will be handled with respect provided they were raised honestly and in good faith.</p>
